# Vaccummworld
The vacuum environment is a 2-dimensional grid world, populated with fixed obstacles, dust, and vacuum cleaning robots called *VacBots*. The VacBots are controllable entities that can be controlled by agents. Their task is to move around the grid, avoiding the obstacles, and finding and cleaning the colourful dust.
